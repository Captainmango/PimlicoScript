When creating panels for PIMscript, make price the first thing that appears.

Then have probing questions that should be asked.

In the unsure panel, create a decesion assistance tool to make choices for the customer.
THIS WILL ONLY BE USED TO INFORM A CHOICE. THE CUSTOMER WILL STILL HAVE TO AGREE TO WHAT THE SYSTEM DECIDES.
