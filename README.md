# PimlicoScript

Dev notes for PimlicoScript

Initially, create basic app that can give call reasons to phone calls.

Future changes:
  Linking with sql database
  Ticket generation and remote printing
  Availabilty management from app
  Prevent call recording during CC detail capture
  Encrypt card details

Reporting will be in Excel for the short term. When the Db connector is finished and space is created, a portion of the database will be kept aside for call data. Ideally, this is a short term scenario until we can get a better quality management software in place.

### 30/09/2016
Completed base app. Need to write scripts and code database connector. some quality of life improvements will need to be made. i.e. enter to submit selection and arrow keys to change focussed component.
